# Airline Kiosk 
**C++**

Provides a simple menu for flight ticket transactions.

## Purpose
The goal was to produce a flexible yet simplistic console user interface for a user to purchase flight tickets. 
I wanted to give the user the option to choose from different class tickets and be able to navigate through the menu in an intuitive way.

## How It Works
1. Choose a class
    - The traveler may choose what class of flight ticket they would like to purchase. Their options include first, business, or economic class.
      If the kiosk has ran out of certain class of ticket then it will no longer be displayed as available for purchase.
1. How Many?
    - After choosing the desired class the user will decide how many tickets they would like to purchase.
1. Finalize Purchase
    - Once the amount of tickets has been established, then the user will be shown the total cost for their tickets included sales tax.
      They may select to finalize their order or start a new one.

## What I Learned
I learned to utilize loop structures to intuitively move the user through the menus. This helped keep a consistent flow to avoid confusion. 
I also learned to implement error checking and troubleshooting techniques to keep the program from exhibiting unwanted behavior. Through discord 
I was able to collaborate with 30+ students to lay the framework for this program.
